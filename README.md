# Elm-Intro
Practice with Elm language

Using this repo to learn about and practice writing the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) language.
Elm is a functional language for that compiles to Javascript.

This repo started following the [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org). Currently it is web game where the player tries to spell as many words as possible with a randomly generated set of letters. This uses some concepts that are fairly different in Elm than they are in Javascript. These include generating random values, making HTTP requests, and parsing JSON.
